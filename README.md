# Iris-Flower-Classification
The project created by me
Task-1: Iris Flowers Classification ML Project
IDE: Jupyter Notebook
Language: python
Project :This particular ML project is usually referred to as the “Hello World” of Machine Learning. The iris flowers dataset contains numeric attributes, and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms, mainly how to load and handle data. Also, since this is a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities.

The data set consists of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

the steps involved are:

introduction
Importing different Pakages and liberaries of python.
Load the given data.
Showing the information of given dataset.
Description of dataset.
Ploting the information using matplot.
Model Training.
Model Checking and Classification report.
Testing the model.
